#one more way to open and close the file with open(full file path) as objectref
#with open('test.txt') as file #this automatically closes the file after execution completed

#to open the file in read mode use 'r' flag
#with open('test.txt', 'r') as file

#to write the file use 'w' flag
#with open('test.txt', 'w') as file

#Note: if no flag mentioned by default python takes that as a read mode
#Step 1: read the file and store all the lines in the list
with open('test.txt', 'r') as reader:
    content = reader.readlines() #['abc\n', 'edv\n', 'cedf\n', 'dhjk\n', 'elephant']
#Step 2: reverse the list
  #  reversed(content) #['elephant','dhjk\n', 'cedf\n', 'edv\n', 'abc\n']
#Step 3: write the list back to the file
    with open('test.txt','w') as writer:
        for line in reversed(content):
            writer.write(line)
